# 📧 Spam vs Ham Classifier using Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates a text classification model that distinguishes between spam and ham (non-spam) messages using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm. The dataset contains labeled SMS messages, and the model is trained to predict whether a message is spam or not based on its content.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:  By Using vectorization techniques like TF-IDF to know importance of the words.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of the **GaussianNB** algorithm.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix , precision , recall , f1_score.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: Well-commented code in a notebook format for easy understanding and experimentation.

## 📊 Dataset
- SMS spam collection dataset with labeled examples of spam and ham messages.
- Common dataset used in NLP and text classification tasks.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook `Spam Ham Data Naive Bays.ipynb` in Jupyter or VSCode.  
3. Run through the cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## ✅ Outcome
The model achieves high accuracy in classifying SMS messages, showcasing how simple yet powerful the Naive Bayes algorithm is for natural language processing tasks.
